Title: Computation and Visualization of Empirical Joint Distribution
        (Empirical Joint CDF)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: En-shuo Hsu, Jeffrey C. Miecznikowski

Description: Computes and visualizes empirical joint distribution of multivariate data with optimized algorithms and multi-thread computation. There is a faster algorithm using dynamic programming to compute the whole empirical joint distribution of a bivariate data. There are optimized algorithms for computing empirical joint CDF function values for other multivariate data. Visualization is focused on bivariate data. Levelplots and wireframes are included.
